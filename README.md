### This is an OTX based on version 2 of mattyx
I want to create an OTX with several functionalities, in addition to those that already exist in OTX 2, thus bringing direct services to the source to be used.

### About this open source
  - custom source with scripts and modifications / improvements, based on Mattyx's OTX 2.x source, this has a global lib with several changes and optimizations, based on my source used in deletebra OT
